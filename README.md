# Facial and EMotion Recognition
This repository was developed to enable facial recognition and emotion detection for various use cases, including security and access control. The project incorporates face detection, facial recognition to unlock devices, and emotion recognition using deep learning techniques. The primary focus is on leveraging advanced algorithms for face recognition, ensuring both security and efficiency.

## Features
- Facial Recognition API: Provides a robust API for recognizing faces based on a pre-trained model. The API can be integrated into various applications for facial recognition and access control. <br>
- Face Detection for Unlocking: Implements face detection as a method for unlocking devices. The system detects and matches the user's face with stored data to grant access. <br>
- Emotion Recognition: Recognizes and classifies basic human emotions (such as happy, sad, angry, etc.) using deep learning models, providing insights into user sentiment or state. <br>
- Security-focused: Designed with security in mind, ensuring facial data is handled responsibly and accurately to meet security standards. <br>
 
## Technologies Used
`Deep Learning:` Utilizes deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch for training and deploying facial recognition models. <br>
`Python 3.10:` The project is developed using Python 3.10, making use of the latest features and improvements of the Python programming language.
